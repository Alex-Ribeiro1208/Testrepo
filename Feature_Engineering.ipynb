In particular, we will set out to improve on a baseline set of features via **feature engineering**: deriving new features from our existing data.

In particular, we'll calculate deviance of a row's feature value from the mean value of the category that row belongs to. This helps to capture information about a feature relative to the category's distribution, e.g. how nice a house is relative to other houses in its neighborhood or of its style.\n\nBelow we define reusable code for generating features of this form, feel free to repurpose it for future feature engineering work!"

Generally, feature engineering often follows a sort of [_Pareto principle_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pareto_principle), where a large bulk of the predictive gains can be reached through adding a set of intuitive, strong features like polynomial transforms and interactions. Directly incorporating additional information like categorical variables can also be very helpful. Beyond this point, additional feature engineering can provide significant, but potentially diminishing returns. Whether it's worth it depends on the use case for the model. "
